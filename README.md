# Programming in C and C++

This repository contains a collection of problems I worked on during my first semester at university.  
The main goal of this project is to document my learning process and practice fundamental programming concepts in C and C++.

## Topics Covered
- linked Lists  
- stacks  
- queues  
- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (C++)

## About
These solutions were written primarily for my own learning. They may not always be fully optimized or entirely correct, but I have added comments to explain the algorithms and thought process behind them.  
I created this repository as a study resource, but I hope it can also be useful to anyone looking to strengthen their understanding of basic data structures and programming concepts.

## Note
This repository is intended for educational purposes and does not represent production-ready code.
